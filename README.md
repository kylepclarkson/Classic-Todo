# Classic-Todo (in production)

A classic Todo application built with a Django backend and React frontend. A weekend project to brush up on my api design skills and making calls with Javascript. 

Allows for a user to create, edit, and delete todo items - a line of text.

## Updating:
Implementing user feature to allow several users of the app. Integrating redux into the frontend to manage state.
